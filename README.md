# GMod-Nextbots
Nextbot entities for use in Garry's Mod. Code in Lua.

Details on development process to be added - including development of images and audio.

# Abyss
Heavily based off of "Smiley (NEXTBOT)" by 󠀡󠀡LΛVΛ. Smiley is a basic nextbot. Image and audio changed. Only code changes are:

local MUSIC_CUTOFF_DISTANCE = 2000000 from 20000

local MUSIC_abyss_PANIC_COUNT = 1 from 8

Abandoned in favour of working on Abyssal.

# Abyssal
Heavily based off of "Terminus Nextbot" by syhgma, which itself is based off of "Gargitron NextBot" by Gargin. Terminus is a "stalker" nextbot, with decision making more complex than many nextbots currently available. Image and almost all audio changed. Code edited in small ways already, many more changes to be made. Changes include a fix to how Terminus was coded to count escaped chases.

Comments with notation --. are my own. Comments with just -- are previous developers.
